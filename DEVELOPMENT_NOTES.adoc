== Ideas to explore

=== Modify `rb_profile_frames` to receive target thread

It looks like replacing the `GET_EC()` call with a specific thread is doable.

=== Understand why `rb_profile_frames` does not return the correct iseq for a block.

Given

[source,ruby]
----
def run
  puts "Backtracist: " + Backtracist.caller_locations.first.label
  puts "Ruby:        " + caller_locations.first.label
end

def run2
  1.times do
    run
  end
end
----

the output is

----
Backtracist: run2
Ruby:        block in run2
----

this is because inside `rb_profile_frames` the code goes

[source,c]
----
/* record frame info */
cme = rb_vm_frame_method_entry(cfp);
if (cme && cme->def->type == VM_METHOD_TYPE_ISEQ) {
  buff[i] = (VALUE)cme;
}
else {
  buff[i] = (VALUE)cfp->iseq;
}
----

and in this case the first branch is taken (we get the `cme`, not the `cfp->iseq`). I have no idea why.

== TODO

* Benchmarking
* Tackle FIXMEs
* Support Ruby < 3.0
* Support showing class name, e.g. https://ivoanjo.me/blog/2020/07/05/ruby-experiment-include-class-names-in-backtraces/
* Go beyond class name, e.g. https://ivoanjo.me/blog/2020/07/19/better-backtraces-in-ruby-using-tracepoint/
* Implement equivalents to `Kernel#caller`, `Thread#backtrace`, `Thread#backtrace_locations`
* Implement limits (similar to the arguments passed to the regular Ruby APIs)
* User documentation
